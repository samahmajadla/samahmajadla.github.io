Both during and after college, I worked various roles in hospitality and marketing, while pursuing my degree in economics. Weirdly enough, that\u2019s exactly the skill set needed in live operations: analysis, a curiosity of human behavior, and event and monetization planning. <br> I work with an array of teams across development, design, art, QA, community, and more, while looking at data tools to determine the best plans of action moving forward. <br> <br> While I\u2019m not sitting at my desk, I enjoy sitting at my other desk to play Minecraft or sitting at the living room playing couch co-op games like Army of Two. <br> <br> When I\u2019m not sitting, I\u2019m playing volleyball, lifting at the gym, bowling, or going on random walks that always end up in a foodie trip.'},{name:"Samah Majadla",current:!1,img:"samah_headshot_small.jpeg",alt:"Samah smiling for the camera",bio:`You can learn more
