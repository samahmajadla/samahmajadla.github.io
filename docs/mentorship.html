Both during and after college, I worked various roles in hospitality and marketing, while pursuing my degree in economics. Weirdly enough, that’s exactly the skill set needed in live operations: analysis, a curiosity of human behavior, and event and monetization planning. <br> I work with an array of teams across development, design, art, QA, community, and more, while looking at data tools to determine the best plans of action moving forward. <br> <br> While I’m not sitting at my desk, I enjoy sitting at my other desk to play Minecraft or sitting at the living room playing couch co-op games like Army of Two. <br> <br> When I’m not sitting, I’m playing volleyball, lifting at the gym, bowling, or going on random walks that always end up in a foodie trip.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></span></div>

			In the years since, I’ve been able to grow a lot in my role and hone my skills in distributed
			systems, code cleanliness, and frontend development.

			As someone whose career was made possible by the willingness of my friends and colleagues to give
			me a chance despite a lack of formal accreditation, mentorship has always been an important means
			for me to give back to the community and lift up other talented, hard-working individuals that
			haven’t had that same fortune of circumstance. I believe anyone with drive and desire can succeed
			in this field and I hope to be able to help elevate new technologists in their career goals.
		
			Outside of work, I’m a fan of food, artsy stuff, and comedy. As a Detroiter living in NYC, I have
			great access to all three, and I love getting the chance to bring my friends and family around
			for Broadway shows and Korean BBQ.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></span></div>

I was recently promoted to manage a software engineering team called FordLabs (check us out! www.fordlabs.com). These days I'm still working on learning about the usual things that come with management, leadership strategies, a bit of bureaucracy, and figuring out how to best help my team. When I get to jump in the code, I love experimenting with little ideas that can help make the big idea go. Sometimes I just experiment with huge ideas for the fun of it.

I now have over 9 years of experience across several different information technology roles (primarily on the platform side of IT). I'm currently a Solutions Architect, with a focus on Kubernetes, observability/monitoring, CI/CD, and computer infrastructure. My favorite things to work on are Kubernetes and building intuitive dashboards through Grafana/Prometheus. Outside of work I enjoy tinkering on my car, flying general aviation aircraft recreationally, traveling (going to different beaches), exercising and helping struggling nonprofit companies with different IT related issues theyre dealing with.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></span></div>
